This mod fixes lag spikes (noticable in large world) and syncing issue in CalamityMod v2.0.2.2

!WARNING!
Do NOT use it on any other versions. This mod (almost) doesn't have safety checks so it will probably crash or lag even more.
!WARNING!

I'm pretty sure Calamity devs will fix this issue asap. This mod is for inpatient players like me.
